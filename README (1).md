# Healthcare Data Analysis Using Python
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare appointment data to uncover patterns and insights related to patient demographics, health conditions, and appointment attendance rates. The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about patient appointments, including details on gender, age, health conditions, and whether the patient showed up for their appointment. The data includes the following key features:

- Gender: Male or Female
- Age: Age of the patient
- Neighbourhood: The location of the patient's residence
- Scholarship: Indicates whether the patient has a scholarship (financial aid)
- Hypertension: Indicates whether the patient has hypertension
- Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes
- SMS Received: Indicates whether the patient received an SMS reminder
- Appointment Day: The day the appointment was scheduled
- Show/No-Show: Indicates whether the patient attended the appointment


## Key Findings
1. Gender Disparity in Appointments: Female patients have taken more appointments than male patients.

2. Show/No-Show Ratio by Age Group: The ratio of no-show to show is almost equal across most age groups, except for Age 0 and Age 1, which have a show rate of approximately 80%.

3. Neighbourhood Show Rate: Each neighborhood shows an approximately 80% show rate, indicating consistent attendance across different areas.

4. Scholarship Influence:

- Without Scholarship: 99,666 patients without a scholarship, with about 80% attending their appointments.
- With Scholarship: 21,801 patients with a scholarship, with about 75% attending their appointments.

5. Hypertension and Attendance:

- Without Hypertension: 88,726 patients, with about 78% attending their appointments.
- With Hypertension: 21,801 patients, with about 85% attending their appointments.
6. Diabetes and Attendance:

- Without Diabetes: 102,584 patients, with about 80% attending their appointments.
- With Diabetes: 7,943 patients, with about 83% attending their appointments.
7. SMS Reminders:

- Without SMS: 75,045 patients did not receive an SMS reminder, with about 84% attending their appointments.
- With SMS: 35,482 patients received an SMS reminder, with about 72% attending their appointments.
8. Appointment Days: There are no appointments scheduled on Sundays, and appointments on Saturdays are significantly fewer compared to other weekdays.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)
## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into patient behavior and appointment attendance in healthcare settings. The findings can help healthcare providers optimize appointment scheduling and improve patient communication strategies.
